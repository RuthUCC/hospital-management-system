PROGRAM OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------------
This is a console-based Hospital Management System built using Python.
The system allows users to manage patient and doctor data, book and cancel appointments, and generate bills.

The program demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP), error handling, and input validation.

----------------------------------------------
PROGRAM FUNCTIONALITY
----------------------------------------------

✔ Register a New Patient:
   - Collects name, age, and gender.
   - Automatically generates a unique patient ID.

✔ Add a New Doctor:
   - Collects name, age, gender, specialty, and available schedule.
   - Schedule must include date and time (e.g. "2025-07-18 10:00").
   - Automatically generates a unique doctor ID.

✔ View Patient Profile:
   - Enter the patient ID to view their profile.

✔ View Doctor Schedule:
   - Enter the doctor ID to see their specialty and availability.

✔ Book an Appointment:
   - Requires patient ID, doctor ID, date, and time.
   - Checks for scheduling conflicts and doctor availability.

✔ Cancel an Appointment:
   - Requires the appointment ID.
   - Updates the status and removes the time slot.

✔ Generate a Bill:
   - Displays patient and appointment details.
   - Calculates a fixed consultation fee plus optional service      fees.

✔ Input Validation:
   - Ensures age is a positive number.
   - Name must contain only letters.
   - Gender must be Male, Female, or Other.
   - Date must follow YYYY-MM-DD format.
   - Time must follow 24-hour format (HH:MM).

----------------------------------------------
HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
----------------------------------------------

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your computer.
2. Save the program in a .py file (e.g., hospital_system.py).
3. Open the terminal or command prompt on your computer.
4. Navigate to the folder where your file is saved.
5. Copy file path for .py file
6. To run the program, paste the file path
   into the commandline prompt then press enter.
7. Use the menu to interact with the system.

----------------------------------------------
MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED
----------------------------------------------
- None. The system is fully functional from the console.

Optional improvements:
- Add file storage for saving data.
- Add a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using tkinter or PyQt.
- Send confirmation emails when booking appointments, cancelling    appointments, etc. (advanced).

----------------------------------------------
ASSUMPTIONS & LIMITATIONS
----------------------------------------------
- Appointments are scheduled manually; no automatic scheduling or   conflict resolution beyond the current checks.
- Data is not saved between sessions.
- Only text-based interface which is not suitable for multi-user    or networked environments.
